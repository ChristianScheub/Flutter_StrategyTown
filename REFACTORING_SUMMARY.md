# Refactoring Summary: Object-Oriented Design Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to improve the architecture of the Flutter simulation game. The key focus was on implementing proper object-oriented design principles through interfaces and specialized base classes.

## Implemented Interfaces

We successfully implemented several ability-based interfaces in `unit_abilities.dart`:

1. **BuilderUnit** - For units that can build structures
   - Defines methods: `canBuild()`, `getBuildActionCost()`
   - Implemented by: Farmer, Lumberjack, Miner, Commander

2. **CombatCapable** - For units with combat abilities
   - Defines properties: `attackValue`, `defenseValue`, `maxHealth`, `currentHealth`
   - Defines methods: `canAttackAt()`, `calculateDamage()`
   - Implemented by: Archer, Knight, SoldierTroop, Commander

3. **HarvesterUnit** - For units that can harvest resources
   - Defines methods: `canHarvest()`, `getHarvestAmount()`, `getHarvestActionCost()`
   - Implemented by: Farmer, Lumberjack, Miner

4. **SettlerCapable** - For units that can found cities
   - Defines method: `canFoundCity()`
   - Implemented by: Settler

## Specialized Base Classes

We created two base classes in `unit_base_classes.dart` that extend the base `Unit` class:

1. **CivilianUnit** - For non-combat units
   - Extends: `Unit`
   - Used by: Settler, Farmer, Lumberjack, Miner

2. **MilitaryUnit** - For combat units
   - Extends: `Unit` 
   - Implements: `CombatCapable`
   - Used by: Archer, Knight, SoldierTroop, Commander

## UnitFactory

We implemented the Factory Pattern through the `UnitFactory` class, which now provides centralized creation of units:

```dart
static Unit createUnit(UnitType type, Position position) {
  switch (type) {
    case UnitType.settler:
      return Settler.create(position);
    // Other unit types...
  }
}
```

## Service Layer Changes

The `GameService` class was updated to use the new interfaces:

1. **Interface-based checking**: Service methods now check for interface implementations rather than concrete types
   ```dart
   // Before
   if (selectedUnit == null || selectedUnit is! Lumberjack) { ... }
   
   // After
   if (selectedUnit == null || !(selectedUnit is BuilderUnit)) { ... }
   ```

2. **Polymorphism**: Methods now work with interface methods instead of unit-specific methods
   ```dart
   // Before
   if (!lumberjack.canBuildLumberCamp() || !tile.canBuildLumberCamp()) { ... }
   
   // After
   if (!builderUnit.canBuild(BuildingType.lumberCamp, tile)) { ... }
   ```

3. **Resource Harvesting**: Now uses the `HarvesterUnit` interface for harvesting resources
   ```dart
   // Before
   final harvestAmount = 10; // Fixed amount for all units
   
   // After
   final harvestAmount = harvesterUnit.getHarvestAmount(resourceType);
   ```

## UI Improvements

The UI layer was also updated to work with the new interfaces:

1. **Unit Widget**: Now shows different visual indicators based on unit abilities
   - Combat capability icon for `CombatCapable` units
   - Builder icon for `BuilderUnit` implementers
   - Harvester icon for `HarvesterUnit` implementers

2. **Action Panel**: Now displays actions based on interfaces rather than concrete types
   ```dart
   // Before
   if (unit is Farmer && unit.canBuildFarm()) { ... }
   
   // After
   if (unit is BuilderUnit && unit is Farmer) {
     if (builderUnit.canBuild(BuildingType.farm, tile)) { ... }
   }
   ```

## Tests

Unit tests were added to verify interface implementations and specialized functionality:
- Tests for interface implementation verification
- Tests for proper unit building capabilities
- Tests ensuring units can only perform their specialized tasks

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common functionality is now in interfaces and base classes
2. **Better Type Safety**: Unit capabilities are expressed through interfaces
3. **Improved Extensibility**: Adding new units or capabilities is easier
4. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each interface represents a specific capability
5. **Enhanced Testability**: Interface-based code is easier to test
6. **Greater Flexibility**: Units can be treated polymorphically based on capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Add more specialized methods to each unit type
2. Implement additional capabilities through new interfaces
3. Refine the combat system using the `CombatCapable` interface
4. Add unit tests for all interfaces and classes
5. Consider additional design patterns to further improve the architecture
